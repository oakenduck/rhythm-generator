### Rhythms: An Exhaustive Collection of Rhythms in Common Time
A compilation using randomly generated measures in 4/4. No rests, from whole notes to 16th notes. Effectively a prototype and proof of concept for what's to come.

## Goals:
- [x] separate mass measure generation from measure generator
- [ ] add lilypond support for instantiating notes
- [ ] add midi I/O
- [ ] add support for tuplets and dotted notes
- [x] combine rests that occur sequentially where appropriate
- [ ] design recursive measure generator for large-scale exhaustive search
